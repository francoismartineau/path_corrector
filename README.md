This script takes the desired folder for argument and will modify the name of every file that it contains.

Additonnal feature for Windows users:
.In order to be able to use the script without the use of a command-line, I included Regedit scripts that will add an entry to run this script from windows explorer's context menu.
 The current folder that's being "explored" will be the script's argument.
.Before adding the registry key, make sure you edit the regedit scripts so the python executable path and the python script path matches yours.
